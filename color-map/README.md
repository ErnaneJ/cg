# Color Map

A color table, also known as a color map, is a data structure that associates intensity values or channel values (such as red, green, and blue) with specific colors. It is frequently used in image visualization and graphics to map data values to visual colors.

For N = 10 and M = 256, we will have the following output:

```cpp
Entry 0: (0, 0, 0);
Entry 1: (25, 25, 25);
Entry 2: (50, 50, 50);
Entry 3: (75, 75, 75);
Entry 4: (100, 100, 100);
Entry 5: (125, 125, 125);
Entry 6: (150, 150, 150);
Entry 7: (175, 175, 175);
Entry 8: (200, 200, 200);
Entry 9: (225, 225, 225);
```

As we can observe, this represents a ramp from 0 to 255 on a grayscale scale, as the intensity of red, green, and blue are the same for each of the points.
